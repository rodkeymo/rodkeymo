# Hi there, I'm Rodney Kipkemoi 👋

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in building scalable web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), **PHP**, and **Python**. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy creating seamless user experiences and robust systems that solve real-world problems. My interests extend to **AI** and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** development, where I explore integrating AI with external systems to enhance application intelligence and data connectivity.
